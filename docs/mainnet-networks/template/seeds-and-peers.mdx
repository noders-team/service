  # Seeds and Peers

###### Chain ID: `[CHAIN_ID]` | Current Node Version: `[VERSION]`

## Our seed node

You might also decide to use a seed node to bootstrap your node.
```bash
[ENDPOINT_SEED]
```

## Our peer

When you state-sync, you might also consider adding [NODERS]TEAM state-sync peer to your persistent_peers setting in `config.toml`.

```bash
[ENDPOINT_PEER]
```

## Live Peers

Here is a list of [LIVE_PEERS_COUNT] active peers as observed by [NODERS]TEAM in real-time. Add them to your `config.toml` if you have trouble finding peers.

```bash
[LIVE_PEERS_ALL]
```

Here is a script for you to update `persistent_peers` setting in `config.toml`. Stale peers can cause node inefficiency over time, so the script below selects a few random live peers.

```bash
PEERS=[LIVE_PEERS_RANDOM]
sed -i.bak -e "s/^persistent_peers *=.*/persistent_peers = \"$PEERS\"/" [DAEMON_HOME]/config/config.toml

sudo systemctl restart [DAEMON_NAME]
sudo journalctl -fu [DAEMON_NAME] --no-hostname -o cat
```

## Address book

The address book contains a list of previously connected peers. It helps your node find and connect to the network quickly. Download our address book to speed up your initial connection:

```bash
curl https://snapshots.noders.services/[CHAIN_SYSTEM_NAME]/addrbook.json -o [DAEMON_HOME]/config/addrbook.json
sudo systemctl restart [DAEMON_NAME]
```
