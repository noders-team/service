<CodeParams>

### Parameters:

**None**

### Result:

The result will be a JSON object as defined in `authorize`, but the values may be updated and differ
from the values originally provided in the `authorize` response for the auth token.

- `max_transactions_per_request`: (optional) if present, the max number of transaction payloads which can be signed by a single `sign_transactions` or `sign_and_send_transactions` request. If absent, the implementation doesn’t publish a specific limit for this parameter.
- `max_messages_per_request`: (optional) if present, the max number of transaction payloads which can be signed by a single sign_messages request. If absent, the implementation doesn’t publish a specific limit for this parameter.
- `supported_transaction_versions`: the Solana network transaction formats supported by this wallet endpoint. Allowed values are those defined for `TransactionVersion` (for e.g., "legacy", 0, etc).
- `features`: a list of <Link to="https://solana-mobile.github.io/mobile-wallet-adapter/spec/spec.html#feature-identifiers">feature identifiers</Link> for the optional features supported by the wallet. Dapps can assume that mandatory features are supported by the wallet.
