# The Internet of Blockchains

Cosmos aims to create an "Internet of Blockchains," a network enabling different blockchains to communicate, share data, and transact with one another. This interoperability seeks to solve the problem of isolated blockchain networks. With its scalable and customizable ecosystem, Cosmos facilitates the development of decentralized applications and allows for the creation of interconnected blockchain networks, leveraging the Tendermint consensus algorithm for high performance and security.
