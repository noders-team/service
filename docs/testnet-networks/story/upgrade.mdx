```bash
mkdir -p ~/.story/story/cosmovisor/upgrades/v1.2.0/bin
cd $HOME
rm -rf story
git clone https://github.com/piplabs/story
cd story
git checkout v1.2.0

mv $HOME/story/story ~/.story/story/cosmovisor/upgrades/v1.2.0/bin/
```

```

Monitor the logs to ensure the upgrade was successful:

```bash
sudo journalctl -u story -u story-geth -f
```
